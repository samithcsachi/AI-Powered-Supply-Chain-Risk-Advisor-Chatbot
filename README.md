# AI-Powered-Supply-Chain-Risk-Advisor-Chatbot
Problem Statement:

Global supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to disruptions caused by weather events, geopolitical instability, logistics delays, and unforeseen incidents. Small and mid-sized businesses often lack real-time visibility and actionable insights to proactively manage these risks, leading to delays, increased costs, and operational inefficiencies.

Current solutions are either expensive, limited to large enterprises, or rely on manual monitoring, failing to provide accessible, instant, and intelligent guidance to those who need it most.

This project addresses:
“How can we empower businesses and logistic managers with a free, intelligent, real-time AI chatbot that analyzes global supply chain data and external events to forecast risks, provide actionable recommendations, and support resilient decision-making—without reliance on expensive enterprise solutions?”

Summary:
You are solving the problem of accessible, real-time supply chain risk detection and mitigation for all, using AI-driven conversational analysis and open data sources.Problem Statement:
Supply chains face unpredictable disruptions—from weather, politics, strikes, and logistics bottlenecks—that can delay shipments, raise costs, and impact business continuity. Most solutions are expensive and inaccessible for small and mid-sized companies, who end up with little real-time insight or actionable risk mitigation advice.

This project aims to build a free, open-source AI chatbot that proactively monitors global supply chain risks with open data, forecasts disruptions, and delivers actionable recommendations to decision makers—all through an easy conversational interface.
The goal: democratize supply chain risk intelligence, making real-time monitoring and mitigation accessible to any business.
